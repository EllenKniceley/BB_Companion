        <item>Each team gains a free Bribe Inducement. This Inducement must be used before the end of the game or it is lost.</item>
        <item>If the kicking team\'s turn marker is on turn 6, 7, or 8 for the half, both coaches move their turn marker back one
        space. Otherwise, both coaches move their turn marker forward one space.</item>
        <item>D3+3 open players on the kicking team may be removed and set up again in different locations, following all of
        the usual set-up rules.</item>

        the same square the ball will land in.</item>
        <item>Both coaches roll a D6 and add the number of cheerleaders on their Team Draft list. The coach with the highest total may
        immediately roll once on the Prayers to Nuffle table. In the case of a tie, neither coach rolls on the Prayers to Nuffle table.
        Note that if you roll a result that is currently in effect, you must re-roll it.</item>

        from among those on the pitch. In the case of a tie, both coaches randomly select a player. Roll a D6 for the selected player(s).
        On a roll of 2+, the player and the ref argue and it comes to blows. The player is placed prone and becomes stunned. On a roll of 1, the
        player is immediately sent off.</item>
        <item>Both coaches roll a D6 and add their fan factor to the result. the coach that rolls the lowest randomly selects D3 of their players
